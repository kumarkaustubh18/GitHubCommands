                                                         How to push Your work in Github
To push your work to GitHub, you can follow these general steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub.

Initialize a local Git repository on your computer and connect it to the remote GitHub repository.

Add your files to the local repository and commit your changes.

Push your changes from the local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

Here are the detailed steps to push your work to GitHub:

Create a new repository on GitHub:

Log in to your GitHub account.
Click on the "New" button on the left-hand side of the dashboard or on the top-right corner of the page.
Give your repository a name, add a description if you like, and choose the type of repository you want to create.
Click on the "Create repository" button.
Initialize a local Git repository on your computer and connect it to the remote GitHub repository:

Open your terminal or Git Bash and navigate to the directory where you want to create your local repository.
Type "git init" to initialize a new Git repository.
Type "git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git" to connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository.
Add your files to the local repository and commit your changes:

Add the files you want to push to GitHub using the "git add" command. For example, to add all files in the current directory, type "git add ."
Commit your changes using the "git commit" command. For example, type "git commit -m 'Initial commit'" to commit your changes with a message.
Push your changes from the local repository to the remote repository on GitHub:

Type "git push -u origin main" to push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. This will create a new branch called "main" on the remote repository and push your changes to that branch.
Congratulations! Your work is now pushed to GitHub. You can view your repository on GitHub and see your changes.
